  <h1>How can house plants be affordable?</h1>
  <p>Bringing the outside in doesn't need to be an investment, healthy house plants can be bought for a good price at your local garden center, why dont you take home a house plant today?   </p>
  <p>Larger house plants can be bought for around Â£40 however smaller plants are much cheaper. Do keep in mind plants and their price can depend on their size how common they are and time of year, your local garden center will be able to guide you to their beginner plants within your budget. Most house plants dont need any special soil in their pots and when they out grow their pot, they can be transfered with little to no problems. Of course seeds are also an affordable option which allows you to see the full growth of your plant do keep in mind you will need to repot the plant as it grows.      </p>
