  <h1>How to care for your house plant</h1>
  <p>This page is dedicated to tell you your house plants needs.</p>
  <p>All plants have different  watering requirements depending on their country of origin, plants in a appropriate size pot should be watered when the top half of the soil feels dry to touch. The most common way a house plant dies is overwatering, so its best to be cautious with how often you water your plant.  </p>
  <p>When should you repot your houseplant? Your plants roots are the key to know, if the roots are circling inside its current container its time to repot it. Spring is the best time to repot your plant, but if you need to repot during any other season it won't do your plant any harm.   </p>
  <p>Leaves and flowers die off and fade away, to make sure your plant is healthy and looking its best be sure to remove the withered leaves and faded flowers. </p>
  <p>Dont forget that your plant needs plenty of sunlight around the whole plant so be sure to rotate the plant so it gets sunlight evenly.
